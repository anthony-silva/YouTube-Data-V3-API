A YouTube Data V3 REST API I developed using the Django Rest Framework. 

Allows users to search youtube channels by username and retrieve useful channel information such as total video count, subscriber count, total views, etc. 

Also created user functionality for registering accounts and logging in/out to gain access to the platform. 

Finally, I implemented an AWS Postgres Database, along with Elasticsearch to reduce API calls and speed up queries.
